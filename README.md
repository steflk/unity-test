# unity-test
Store of all files that I have developed in Unity

## Project Description
This Unity project was created as a learning space, i.e. all files in this repository were created while learning and experimenting with Unity. The purpose is to display my work with coding rather than to create a game that would be shared publicly, for this reason the game is currently not available to play.
